# spring-project-221
Pet Store Site

Final project for my OOP class from the fall of 2023. Project utilizes the spring framework in java to build a pet store website. 

Main features are that the site only permits unauthorized users to view home, contact, and about page using springs security. Upon login, the user can add, edit, or delete the pet's listed on the site.
